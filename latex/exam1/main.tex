    \section*{Tactics}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|rw[HYPOTHESIS]|: Substitutes the left hand side of an equality in \texttt{[HYPOTHESIS]} with the right hand side
        \item \verb|rel[HYPOTHESIS]|: Substitutes the left hand side of an inequality in \texttt{[HYPOTHESIS]} with the right hand side; also applies rules of modular arithmetic such as the addition, subtraction, negative, and multiplication rules. 
        \item \verb|addarith[HYPOTHESIS]|: basic addition and subtraction with the provided hypothesis. 
        \item \verb|have [HYPOTHESIS_NAME] : [STATEMENT] := by [REASONING]|: creates a new hypothesis called \\ \verb|HYPOTHESIS_NAME| for future reference. 
        \item \verb|ring|: used as justification for things related to ring properties such as addition, subtract, multiplication (and sometimes division) with variables or ring elements
        \item \verb|extra|: used as justification for when an inequality differs by a neutral positive value. Eg: \texttt{y < 1 + y := by extra}
        \item \verb|cancel [ITEM] at [HYPOTHESIS]|: essentially divides both sides of an (in)equality by \verb|[ITEM]| and rewrites the hypothesis, as long at the value you are canceling is not 0. Eg: if \texttt{h1 : t\^{}2 = t} and \texttt{h2: t $\geq$ 0}, then \texttt{cancel t at h1} would give \texttt{h1 : t = 1}. Note as well that you can cancel powers: if you have \texttt{h3 : a\^{}2$\geq$ 1} you can \texttt{cancel 2 at h3} to give \texttt{h3 : a $\geq$ 1}
        \item \verb|numbers|: Provides justification for any statement involving only numbers. If there is a hypothesis that cannot be true (such as $0 > 7$), \texttt{numbers at [HYPOTHESIS]} can be used to show a contradiction
        \item \verb|exact [HYPOTHESIS]|: Given \texttt{[HYPOTHESIS]} that matches the goal exactly, close the goal using \\ \verb|exact [HYPOTHESIS]|
        \item \verb|apply [HYPOTHESIS]|: Used to choose a specific value for hypothesis' involving the universal quanitifier.
        \item \verb|mod_cases hx : x % n|: Creates $n$ different cases with the hypothesis \texttt{hx : x $\equiv$ k [ZMOD n]} for $0 \leq k < n$
        \item \verb|interval_cases x|: If $x$ is bounded above and below, \texttt{interval\_cases} creates a case for each possible value of $x$
        \item \verb|contradiction|: If there are two hypothesis that connot be simultaneously true, then \verb|contradiction| closes the goal
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{OR Goals and Hypothesis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb+obtain h1 | h2 := h3+: splits a hypothesis in the form $x \lor y$ into two seperate goals.
        \item \verb|left|: Given a goal in the form \texttt{a $\lor$ b}, chooses to prove the left side, \texttt{a}
        \item \verb|right|: Given a goal in the form \texttt{a $\lor$ b}, chooses to prove the right side \texttt{b}
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{AND Goals and Hypothesis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{obtain $\langle$ h1 , h2 $\rangle$ := h3}: splits a hypothesis in the form $x \land y$ into two sepreate hypothesis's
        \item \verb|constructor|: Splits a goal involving AND into two seperate goals to be closed sequentially
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Existential Quanitifier Goals and Hypothesis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|use [VALUE(S)]|: For goals involving existance, provided \texttt{[VALUE(S)]} are the value(s) for the quanities that we must prove the existance of.
        \item \texttt{obtain $\langle$ x, hx $\rangle$ := h}: Creates a value and a hypothesis from another hypothesis that has the existential quantifer in it. Eg. if \texttt{h1 : $\exists$ a : $\RR$, a * t < 0} then, \texttt{obtain $\langle$ x, hx $\rangle$ := h1} gives \texttt{hx : x * t < 0} (often used with even/odd and divisibility proofs)
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection*{Universal Quantifier Goals and Hypothesis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|intro x|: For goals that contain JUST the universal quantifier, introduces a variable \verb|x| for use 
        \item \verb|intro x hx|: For goals that contain implication, introduces a variable \verb|x| and a hypothesis \verb|hx| such that \verb|x| satisfies the proposition. 
    \end{itemize}
    \section*{Lemmas}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|apply ne_of_lt|: Changes any goal in the form of $x \neq y$ to $x < y$ (usually paired with \verb|apply ne_of_gt|)
        \item \verb|apply ne_of_gt|: Changes any goal in the form of $x \neq y$ to $y < x$ (usually paired with \verb|apply ne_of_lt|)
        \item \verb|le_or_lt x y|: Creates an OR hypothesis of the form \texttt{x $\leq$ y $\lor$ x $<$ y}
        \item \verb|le_or_gt x y|: Creates an OR hypothesis of the form \texttt{x $\leq$ y $\lor$ x $>$ y} (best used with hypothesis in the form $x \neq y$)
        \item \verb|apply abs_le_of_sq_le_sq'|: if \texttt{x \^{} 2 $\leq$ y \^{} 2} and \texttt{0 $\leq$ y}, then \texttt{-y $\leq$ x $\land$ x $\leq$ y}
        \item \verb|apply le_antisymm|: Changes a goal in the form of \texttt{a = b} into two subgoals \texttt{a $\leq$ b} and \texttt{a $\geq$ b}
        \item \verb|rw[mul_eq_zero] at [HYPOTHESIS]|: If you have \texttt{[HYPOTHESIS]} in the form \texttt{xy = 0}, then \\ \verb|rw[mul_eq_zero] at [HYPOTHESIS]| gives \texttt{[HYPOTHESIS : x = 0 $\lor$ y = 0]}
        \item \verb|Int.even_or_odd n|: Creates a hypothesis in the form \texttt{Even n $\lor$ Odd n} that any integer \texttt{n} must be even or odd
        \item \verb|apply Int.not_dvd_of_exists_lt_and_lt|: Used to prove that one integer does not divide another. Creates a goal in the form \texttt{$\exists$ q, b * q < q $\land$ a < b * (q + 1)}, or essentially that if \texttt{a} is between two multiple of \texttt{b}, then \texttt{b} cannot divide \texttt{a}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|dsimp[DEFINITION] at *|: rewrites all written occurences of \texttt{[DEFINITION]} in terms of its mathematical definition.
        \item \texttt{Odd (n : $\ZZ$)}: \texttt{n = 2 * k + 1}
        \item \texttt{Even (n : $\ZZ$)}: \texttt{n = 2 * k}
        \item \texttt{( $\cdot$ | $\cdot$ )}: Definition of divisibility, used to unpack goals in the form \texttt{a | b}
    \end{itemize}
